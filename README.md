This final project was done to analyze and forecast electricity usage data over a period of 2016 to 2018. This analysis was done using time series models which include ARIMA, SARIMA, ARCH and GARCH.  The original data gotten for this project contains the hourly usage of electricity used with over 70,000 data point starting from October 2016 to October 2018. The dataset contains columns as start time, end time, date, usage, unit and cost. The original dataset was transformed using python to produce the daily electric usage for same data range. The transformed dataset which produced the daily usage of electric was used for analysis and forecasting. 
The primary focus of this analysis is on the usage of electricity over various period and seasons and by employing these time series models, we aim to identify the trends, patterns and volatility in the electric usage and also forecast the usage of electricity for the next period.
Each model used have unique properties that make them suitable for different time series data, while ARIMA and SARIMA are often used for predicting values, ARCH and GARCH are commonly applied for understanding and predicting volatility and they all have its strength and limitations and the application depends on the specific characteristics of the time series data.
